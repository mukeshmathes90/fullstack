The project focuses on providing real-time case analysis and management. Users can sign up or log in and enter case details, including the case date. The system continuously monitors this data and automatically notifies the user in advance about upcoming case events. Feedback provided through the "Contact Us" page is received and managed within the system.

Future enhancements will include separate logins for users and lawyers. This will enable users to select qualified lawyers from the platform, while lawyers will receive notifications when new cases are registered in their local area, allowing them to stay informed and offer their services moreÂ effectively.
